# 2023.07.02 Doing Nothing

**Beth**: Hello, this is 6 Minute Enghlish from BBC Learning English. I'm Beth.

**Neil**: And I'm Neil. I've spent all day in meeting, then shopping, then collecting the kids from school. I'm exhausted, Beth! What have you been doing today?

**Beth**: Oh, not much, just sitting around doing nothing... relaxing and **kicking back**.

**Neil**: Lucky you! Don't you have any work to do?

**Beth**: It may not look it, Neil, but I'm actually as busy as a bee! If you've seen the nature documentaries about worker bees flying from flower to flower, you probably think animals are always on the move.

But the surprising truth is, away from the cameras, most animals spend most of the time doing absolutely nothing at all.
